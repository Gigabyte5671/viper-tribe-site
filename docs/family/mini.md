## Modifications
### Scraping Issue
The Razer Viper Mini has supposedly had some QC issues with the plastic center peice causing scraping. 

::: tip
This can go away over time with use.
:::

Requires:

- 400 grit sandpaper

To fix this you must remove the stock sensor feet, sand back any raised areas. The only thing you want touching your surface is the PTFE feet. Replacing the sensor feet is not required.

### Scroll Wheel Mod
This reduces the noise, wobble and increases the smoothness of the Scroll Wheel. As well as silencing the middle mouse clicks.

Requires:

- Alps 9mm Encoder
- Kailh Silent Switch 7.3mm
